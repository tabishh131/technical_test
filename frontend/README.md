This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you need to install the necessary node modules. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file in your project and install all the dependencies listed there.

After installing the node modules, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

The `npm run dev` command starts the development server that will serve your application. It watches for any changes in your source files and automatically reloads the server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
